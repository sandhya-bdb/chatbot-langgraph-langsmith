# AI Chatbot System using LangGraph, LangChain, and OpenAI

This project is an end-to-end exploration of **agentic AI systems** built using LangGraph and LangChain, with a strong emphasis on **observability, debugging, and real-world execution challenges** rather than just happy-path demos.

The repository progresses step by step — from a simple chatbot to **tool-augmented, memory-enabled, and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) agents** — while addressing practical issues related to **environment management, tracing, persistence, and infrastructure**.

All experiments were developed and tested locally and in **GitHub Codespaces**, using **uv** for dependency and Python version management.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

This repository shows how to design, debug, and scale **production-style AI agents**, including:

- **State-based agent workflows** using LangGraph  
- **Tool calling and agent-style decision-making** (mock & real APIs)  
- **Persistent memory and checkpointing using SQLite** (thread-based conversations)  
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** execution with interrupt & resume  
- **LangSmith tracing** for full observability (LLM calls, tools, latency, cost)  
- **Clean Git + Codespaces workflow**, including environment pinning and reproducibility
- Optional Gradio UI for interactive experimentation (used in select notebooks)


## 🧩 Project Evolution (Step-by-Step)

The project was intentionally built incrementally:

1. Simple chatbot  
2. Chatbot with tools  
3. Agent-style chatbot (tool routing & decision-making)  
4. Chatbot with **persistent memory (SQLite + thread-based checkpoints)**  
5. LangSmith tracing & observability  
6. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows  
7. HITL fully traced in LangSmith

## 🧑‍💻 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Example

The project includes a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) agent workflow**, where execution is intentionally paused before performing a sensitive or irreversible action (e.g., executing a stock trade).

**Workflow overview:**
- The AI proposes an action  
- Execution is explicitly interrupted  
- A human reviewer approves or declines the action  
- Execution safely resumes based on the human decision  

This entire workflow is **fully traced in LangSmith**, capturing:
- The interrupt point  
- The human decision  
- The resume path  
- The final execution outcome  

---

## 🔍 LangSmith Tracing & Debugging

LangSmith is used extensively to provide deep observability into the agent system, including:

- LangGraph execution flow  
- LLM calls  
- Tool invocations  
- Human interruptions and resumes  
- Token usage  
- Latency and cost analysis  

---

## ⚠️ Key Challenge Faced

LangSmith tracing did not work reliably in the local development environment due to:

- DNS-level network restrictions on local Wi-Fi  
- Kernel and environment inconsistencies  
- Credential and billing configuration mismatches  

---

## ✅ Solution

👉 **Execution was migrated to GitHub Codespaces**

Codespaces provided:
- A clean and reproducible execution environment  
- No DNS or firewall restrictions  
- Correct and consistent credential loading  
- Immediate and reliable LangSmith tracing  

This migration proved to be a **major learning outcome**, highlighting the importance of environment reproducibility when building and debugging production-grade AI systems.


### ▶️ How to Run the Project
#### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces

Sync dependencies:
```
uv sync
```
Run the HITL agent:
```
python chatbot_hitl.py
```
Follow the approval prompt in the terminal

View traces in LangSmith → Tracing
#### Option 2: Local Setup

Create a .env file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=langgraph_cb
```

Sync dependencies:
```
uv sync
```

Run:
```
python chatbot_hitl.py
```

Note: Local LangSmith tracing may fail due to network or DNS restrictions.
### 📘 Key Learnings

Agentic AI is not just about prompts or logic

- Observability is critical
- Environment and infrastructure matter as much as code
- Human-in-the-Loop workflows require:
- Memory
- Checkpointing
- Careful control flow
- LangSmith makes invisible agent behavior visible
- GitHub Codespaces can solve real-world debugging blockers

## Newly added feature- Persistent Memory with SQLite (LangGraph)

The chatbot now supports **persistent conversational memory** using **LangGraph’s SQLite checkpointer**.

- Memory is stored in a local SQLite database (`memory.db`)
- Conversations are isolated using `thread_id`
- Memory persists across multiple invocations and sessions
- Database files are intentionally excluded from version control via `.gitignore`

This enables realistic multi-turn conversations while keeping the repository clean and production-ready.


### 🚀 Future Improvements

- Multi-agent graphs
- Automated evaluations in LangSmith
- API deployment
